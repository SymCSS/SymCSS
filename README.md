# SymCSS
A CSS framework for backend developers

## Idea
It would be really great if we can style/position elements using the symbols   
For example
``` css
-> to position it to right
<- to position it to left
|| for a card
== for navigation-bar
```

## Features may add
* Self sustained framework
* Minimal css for a beautiful page
* intuitive class names
* As small as possible

## Contributors
* Bug or a feature please make an issue and then work on it, So that the progress can be tracked
